    "Bayesâ€™ Theorem offers a method to compute the probability of data belonging to a specific class, given our prior knowledge. The theorem can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(class|data) = (P(data|class) * P(class)) / P(data)\n",

    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm used for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification tasks. It is known as Naive Bayes or idiot Bayes due to its simplification of probability calculations for each class to ensure tractability.\n",

    "Rather than directly computing the probabilities of each attribute value, Naive Bayes assumes that attributes are conditionally independent, given the class value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption is quite strong and often improbable in real-world data, as it assumes no interaction among attributes. Nevertheless, Naive Bayes performs surprisingly well on data even when this assumption is not met.\n",
